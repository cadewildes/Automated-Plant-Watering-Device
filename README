# Automated Plant Caretaker

## Overview
This device was designed to solve a common problem: many plants receive improper watering due to **neglect, lack of knowledge, or lack of time**.  
Our system provides an **automatic, low-maintenance watering solution** that ensures soil moisture is kept within a user-defined range, requiring only a weekly reservoir refill.

**Built by:** Andrew Gonzalez, Ben Wagner, and Cade Wildes  
**Course:** EGG1040 | Group Design Project | FRCC Mines Academy

## Key Features
- **1L Reservoir** – Waters most plants for a week or more between refills.  
- **Minimal User Input** – User only refills the water reservoir; watering is automatic.  
- **Adjustable Flow Rate & Moisture Thresholds** – Supports different plant species and soil types.  
- **Soil Moisture Detection** – Uses sensor feedback to water only when needed.  
- **Battery Powered** – 9V power source with relay protection for safe pump control.  
- **Low Maintenance Design** – Engineered to last up to a year without major service.

## Design Process
### Initial Concepts
1. **Mechanical clip-based waterer** (gravity-fed).  
2. **Battery powered pump** (automatic control).  
3. **Solar powered pump** (to extend lifetime).  

**Final Concept:** Combination of 2 + 3, battery-powered automatic waterer with soil moisture sensing.  

### Hardware Architecture
- **Reservoir:** 1L watertight container.  
- **Controller:** Raspberry Pi 4 (programmed via Arduino IDE).  
- **Sensors:** Capacitive soil moisture sensor.  
- **Actuation:** Water pump (relay-controlled).  
- **Power:** 9V battery source (budget-friendly change from original solar design).

## Sustainability Analysis
Aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals:  
- **Goal 13: Climate Action** – Low-power operation, reduced water waste.  
- **Goal 15: Life on Land** – Healthier plants, biodiversity protection.  
- **Goal 9: Innovation & Infrastructure** – Promotes accessible IoT tech and potential economic growth.  
- **Goal 11: Sustainable Cities & Communities** – Supports urban green spaces and climate adaptation.  
- **Goal 12: Responsible Consumption** – Encourages efficient resource use and sustainable living.
